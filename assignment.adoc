CPSC 351 Operating System Concepts Project #3
=============================================

Overview
--------
The purpose of this project is to have you write a simulation that explores
the effects of limited memory and memory management policies. Your simulator
will read policy information and the characteristics of the workload from
input files and then will simulate the execution of the processes as well as
decisions of Memory Manager (MM). The simulator will generate an output file
with the trace of important events, as well as the memory map and the input
queue status after each event. At the end of the simulation, your program will
also print the average turnaround time per process. Below we provide the
specifications and details about the project. Please read all the parts of
this hand-out carefully before starting to work on your project

Basic functions of the simulator
--------------------------------
Input file: `in1.txt`

* Out1 for file in1 using paging with memory size = 2000 and page size = 100
* Out2 for file in1 using paging with memory size = 2000 and page size = 200
* Out3 for file in1 using paging with memory size = 2000 and page size = 400

Your simulator will prompt the user for the size of the memory and associated
parameters information. The Memory Size (an integer) denotes the capacity of
the main memory in your simulation (it can be interpreted as a multiple of
Kbytes). The Memory Management Policy is:

The policy parameter will denote the page size (consequently, also the frame
size). You can assume that the Memory Size will always be a multiple of the
page (hence, frame) size.

As an example, to define the memory size to be 2000 kbytes, the interaction
would be the following (simulator prompts in boldface, user responses in
italics):

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Memory size> 2000
Page Size (1: 100, 2: 200, 3: 400)> 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At this point, you will prompt the user for the name of a workload file. This
file will first have an integer value N that tells you how many processes are
defined in the file. The characteristics of each individual process will
include a unique process id on the first line, the time it is submitted to the
system (Arrival Time) and its lifetime after it is admitted to the main memory
(Lifetime in Memory) on the second line, and finally, its memory requirements
(Address Space). These process specifications will be separated by a single
blank line. Processes in the file will be listed in arrival order. If two
processes have the same arrival time, the process listed first in the file goes
on the input queue first.

The Address Space line is a sequence of one or more integers separated by
a single blank. The first integer gives the number of 'pieces' of memory on the
line. This sequence denotes the total size of the address space of the process.
You simply sum these integers to get the overall space requirement.

Note that since the memory is limited, there is no guarantee that a process
will be admitted to the memory as soon as it arrives; thus it may have to wait
until the system can accommodate its memory requirements. The lifetime in
memory information for a given process defines how long the process will run
ONCE IT HAS BEEN GIVEN SPACE IN MAIN MEMORY. If a process is submitted to the
system at time = 100 with Lifetime in Memory = 2000, but it is not admitted to
the memory until time = 1500, then it will complete at time = 1500 + Lifetime
in Memory = 3500. The memory space for a process will be freed by the memory
manager when it completes.

Your simulator must generate output (to the screen) that explicitly shows the
trace of important events that modify the memory contents and input queue,
including:

* Process arrival
* Process admission to the main memory
* Process completion

Please make sure to refer to the input file and the corresponding output files
that illustrate the expected format. When the simulation terminates (when
there are no more processes in the input queue or time reaches 100,000).

Implementation
--------------
For this simulation, you can keep an integer (or long) variable representing
your *virtual clock*. Then you can increment its value until all the processes
have completed, making appropriate memory management decisions along the way
as processes arrive and complete. Each arriving process will be first put to
Input Queue. Processes in Input Queue will be ordered according to their
arrival times (FCFS ordering). Whenever a process completes or a new process
arrives, the memory manager (MM) must be invoked. In case of a completion, MM
will first adjust the memory map to reflect the fact that the memory region(s)
previously allocated to the process is/are now free. After that, (and also
when a new process arrives) MM will check to see if it can move the process at
the head of the input queue to the memory. If so, it will make the allocation
and it will update the input queue. Then it will check whether the head of the
updated input queue (new head) can be also moved to the main memory, and so
on. Even if the current commitments in memory do not allow MM to admit the
process at position X of Input Queue, MM should try to load other processes at
positions X + 1,X + 2, â€¦, and in that order.

* Throughout the project, you will assume that the entire address space of
  a process must be brought to the main memory for execution. MM should not
  bring the pages of a process partially: all of its pages must be brought at
  once. Advanced virtual memory techniques, including demand paging and page
  replacement issues are beyond the scope of this project. Consequently, your
  program can simply ignore any process that it encounters a process whose
  total address space is larger than Memory Size. Note that a large process
  may have to wait in Input Queue until sufficient space is available in
  memory; that is a normal scenario.

* When the MM is allocating a free memory region (hole) to one process/page,
  it may have to choose between the lower end and the upper end of the region.
  In this case, always use the lower end.

* The turnaround time for each process will be computed as the difference
  between its completion time and its arrival time.

* Since the focus of this project is on memory management, do not be concerned
  about the details of CPU scheduling or I/O device management. Just assume
  that the process will be completed after staying in memory for Lifetime in
  Memory time units.

* Feel free to adopt any convenient data structure to represent your memory
  map; *explain it in your write-up.*


Operational details
-------------------
In this project, you can work alone or with two or three students together. No
project team can have more than four members. All members of a team will get
the same project grade.

During the grading process, your program will be compiled and run with various
test files with the same format, so it is your responsibility to make sure
that your program works correctly.

For full credit, you must follow the format of the input file as given above;
during the grading process we will use our own input files in that format to
test your program. You can assume that the input file will contain information
about at most 20 (twenty) processes. The maximum lengths of simulation time
and memory size that can be indicated in the input file are 100,000 and
30,000, respectively.

Submission guideline
--------------------

You have to submit your package on TITANium before 12:55 P.M. on April 30,
2014 (one copy per person/team).

* This assignment MUST be completed using C or C++ on Linux.

* You may work in groups of 3.

* Please hand in your source code electronically (do not submit .o or
  executable code)

* You must make sure that the code compiles and runs correctly.

* Write a README file (text file, do not submit a .doc file) which contains:
** Your Section#, Name and Email Address.
** The programming language you used (i.e. `C` or `C++`).
** A write-up explaining the high-level design of your program.
** How to execute your program.
** Anything special about your submission that we should take note of.

* Place all your files under one directory with a unique name (such as
  p3-[userid] for assignment 3, e.g. p3-ytian).

* Tar the contents of this directory using the following command.

  # E.g. tar -cvf p3-ytian.tar p3-ytian/
  tar cvf [directory name].tar [directory name]

* Use TITANIUM to upload the tared file you created above.

Do not forget to include any information needed to compile and run your
program. If we are not able to compile or run your program, it cannot be
graded; so include all the information. As before, if your submission involves
more than one file, you must tar and compress the files before submitting.
However, please do not use Windows-based compression programs such as WinZip.
